  description: 'Plate tectonic reconstructions
This study coupled global plate tectonic reconstructions
provided by Müller et al. (2016) with mantle flow experiments
to model the evolving mantle structure for the post-Pangea
timeframe. In addition to incorporating relative motion between
plates, the tectonic reconstructions presented here use a hybrid
absolute reference frame based on a moving hotspot model
from Torsvik et al. (2008) from 0–70 Ma, and a true polar wander
corrected paleomagnetic model from Steinberger & Torsvik
(2008) for older times, allowing for a 35 Myr transition period
(70–105 Ma) from one reference frame to the other (Müller et
al., 2016). A key feature of these plate reconstructions is the
algorithm that generates time-evolving and topologically-closed
plate polygons (Gurnis et al., 2012). These global plate topologies
were used to sample the plate velocity field, which was imposed
on the surface of the global mantle flow experiments (Gurnis
et al., 2012).'

  description: 'The preferred models achieve their primary aims of
reproducing the northern drainage of Australia’s epicontinental
sea through the Gulf of Carpentaria into the (proto) Pacific
Ocean during the Cretaceous, as well as the southern drainage
of the Murray-Darling Basin at present-day. This was achieved
by careful selection of suitable dynamic topography models
as boundary conditions, fine-tuning regional erodibility and
through the inclusion of an Australia-Antarctic rift shoulder
during the Cretaceous. In this regard, these models achieve
first-order success, building on the work of Salles et al. (2017)
and earlier paleogeographic reconstructions of the Australian
continent (Gurnis et al., 1998; Norvick, 2003; Struckmeyer et
al., 1990).
Additionally, this work provides new insights into the
elevation of western Australia during the early Mesozoic. Due to the proximity of western Australia to the African mantle
superswell at this time, our models suggest that the region
experienced a broad increase in elevation.'
